# Authentication
One of my 32 skill to becoming a Node Developer 

Authentication is a small website made only to test the authentication of a user 

## Requirements
- Node.js + modules (npm i)
- MongoDB database
- Sendgrid account
  
## How it works?

A user can register and login with the right buttons.

A surface level valdiation is executed to ensure the user uses valid Email and Password format.

After an user verifies it's email using the link sent to them, their account becomes active and can log in.

Once logged in to the website they will be able to see the Secret Page on the navigation header.

### Forgot your password?
If a user fogets their password, the website is capable of sending an Email to the user with a timed token that will allowe the user to change their password.
